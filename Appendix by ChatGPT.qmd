The LLM model provided an early system of skeleton in the organization and adjustment of the voice of this portfolio. However, I did some major edits to make the offered information exactly correspond to my written work experiences and achievements. I changed the generic placeholders with specific and factual explanation of my duties at Sanitas, GM Financial and Nueva EPS. To make my business role stronger, I incorporated objective results including earning more than 6.5 million commissions and exceeding KPIs by 105 percent. Moreover, I updated the personal bio to emphasize my passion of both leadership and digital transformation. To increase genuine and professional tone I have used a professional photograph and provided technical skills and language that are relevant to my career goals in Canada. Hence, despite the great creative backbone provided by the LLM, the final version replicates my authorial voice, professional path as well as strategic location.
