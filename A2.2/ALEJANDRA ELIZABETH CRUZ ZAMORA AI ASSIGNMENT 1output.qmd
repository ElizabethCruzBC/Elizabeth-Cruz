**Executive Summary**

In this report, I explain how I built my one-page MBA Portfolio webpage with the help of three AI tools: Gemini, ChatGPT, and Spreed Chat. I tried to personalize the content by uploading my resume as a PDF. Still the results felt too brief, generic, and sometimes unrealistic and the tools often combined unrelated details, like volunteering and skills, and used language that did not match my actual experience.

I decided to keep the overall structure suggested by the LLMs but rewrite all the content in my own words. I focused on my real achievements, including improving event organization, promoting student engagement, and streamlining operations. I also highlighted my true academic background as a Chemical Engineer and MBA candidate in Operations Management.

When I rewrote the content myself, the portfolio became more authentic, professional, and true to who I am, the final version shows my real experience, goals, and personality. Through this project, I learned that AI tools are helpful for getting started and organizing ideas, but the most important part is adding your own voice to make the result genuine and personal.

***Personal Commentary***

For my one-page MBA Portfolio webpage I used three different Large Language Models (LLMs): Gemini, ChatGPT, and Spreed Chat.
Each one helped me to start the creative process, organize ideas, and find ways to present my background professionally.
All three drafts had important limitations because they often mixed unrelated information, used generic phrases, and sometimes felt too brief or did not match my real background.

***Evaluation of the LLM Outputs***

Gemini

Gemini produced a long and structured text with many professional-sounding details.
It focused heavily on operations and leadership, which matched my MBA concentration, but it also exaggerated some parts. For example it added '5+ years of operational leadership experience' and listed certifications I do not have.
Even though it looked impressive, the tone was too formal and not authentic to how I would describe myself.

ChatGPT

This model gave me a very clear and organized outline.
I even uploaded my resume in PDF so the text would be more personalized.
It did use some real information from my resume, but the final writing still lacked authenticity and it sounded like something written for any MBA student.
The sentences were short and generic, for example “passionate about innovation”, “known for data-driven decision making”, so I decided to rewrite them completely in my own words to truly represent my experience and personality.

Spreed Chat

Spreed Chat offered the most complete explanation about portfolio design and how to make it visual and professional.
I liked its storytelling approach and the idea of highlighting signature projects and core competencies.
The sample text was written for a fictional person “Sarah Jenkins” and was not realistic for my own background.
It mixed volunteering, leadership, and skills in a way that didn’t fit my real experience.

***What I Used and What I Changed***

From all three models, I kept the basic structure: About Me, Education, Professional Experience, Skills and Strengths, and Contact Information.
These sections helped me organize my ideas clearly.
I also used their concept of “value proposition” and the idea of writing quantifiable achievements.

I rewrote nearly every sentence to make it sound authentic, specific, and personal.
I used my real experience, such as my work as Event Coordination Lead and Campus Support Ambassador at UCW, real achievements like improving event organization, promoting student engagement, and streamlining operations and my true academic background as a Chemical Engineer and MBA candidate in Operations Management.

I deleted any exaggerated or unrealistic lines and made sure every point reflected something I had actually done or achieved.
The final text uses a professional but natural tone, written in my own voice, with real data and personality.

***Reflection***

Using three different LLMs was a very helpful process for brainstorming and comparing styles.
Each one gave me useful ideas for structure and formatting, but none of them could represent me accurately.
They tended to mix sections like volunteering with skills, include invented achievements, or use repetitive, generic language.

In my opinion, the LLM drafts were too general and lacked authenticity.
By rewriting everything myself I turned those drafts into a real reflection of who I am, including my background, my goals, and my personality.
The final portfolio now feels genuine and professional, showing both my technical and managerial strengths.
I learned that AI tools are excellent for starting ideas, but the real value comes when you revise and personalize them to tell your own story.
I believe it is very important to give an authentic touch to an online portfolio so that it truly reflects the person behind it and since most interactions are virtual, making the content feel genuine helps create the sense of a real and human connection.

**Appendix A3: SPREED CHAT**

“Create an outline and sample text for a one-page MBA student portfolio.”

Gemini 2.5 Pro

Of course. A one-page MBA student portfolio is a powerful tool for networking and interviews. It's more visual and narrative-driven than a resume, allowing you to showcase your impact and strategic thinking.

Here is a detailed outline and sample text for a one-page MBA student portfolio.

Why a One-Page Portfolio?

It's a "Show, Don't Tell" Document: While a resume lists your experiences, a portfolio demonstrates your accomplishments with context, data, and results.

It's a Conversation Starter: It gives recruiters and networking contacts specific, compelling stories to ask you about.
It Highlights Your Brand: It allows you to frame your unique value proposition—the intersection of your past experience, MBA skills, and future aspirations.

Key Principles for a One-Page Portfolio
Visually Scannable: Use columns, icons, and clear headings. The reader should grasp your story in 30 seconds.

Quantify Everything: Use numbers, percentages, and dollar amounts to demonstrate impact.
Be Concise: Every word counts. Use strong action verbs and remove jargon.

Tell a Story: The projects you choose should build a narrative about who you are and where you're going.

Tailor It: Have a master version, but be prepared to swap out projects or skills to align with a specific role or industry.

Outline for a One-Page MBA Student Portfolio
A two or three-column layout works best for a one-page format.

Section 1: Header & Personal Brand

Full Name

Professional Headshot (optional but recommended)

Contact Information: LinkedIn URL (hyperlinked), Email, Phone Number

Personal Brand Statement / Professional Summary (2-3 lines): Your elevator pitch. Who are you, what’s your key expertise, and what value do you bring?

Section 2: Core Competencies

A visually clean list of your most relevant skills. Group them into categories to make them scannable.
Strategic: e.g., Go-to-Market Strategy, Market Analysis, Competitive Intelligence
Analytical: e.g., Financial Modeling, Data Visualization (Tableau/Power BI), SQL
Leadership: e.g., Cross-Functional Team Leadership, Project Management, Stakeholder Communication
Section 3: Signature Projects / Impact Showcase (The Core of the Portfolio)

This section will take up the most space. Choose 2-3 high-impact projects. Include a mix of pre-MBA professional work and MBA academic/internship projects.
For each project, include:

Project Title: Give it a compelling, results-oriented name.

Context: Company/Course, Your Role, Timeline (e.g., "TechCo Inc., Product Marketing Manager, 2021")
The Challenge (1 line): The business problem you were tasked with solving.
My Approach & Actions (2-3 bullet points): What specific actions did you take? Use strong verbs.
Quantifiable Results (1-2 bullet points): The measurable outcome. This is the most critical part.

Skills Demonstrated: Tag 2-3 key skills from your Core Competencies section.

Section 4: Education & Leadership

A concise section to reinforce your academic and extracurricular credentials.

Education: [University Name], MBA Candidate | [Concentrations]
Leadership/Involvement: Key roles in student clubs (e.g., "VP of Finance, Venture Capital Club") or other relevant activities.

Section 5: Career Aspirations

A short, forward-looking statement about your target roles or industries. This helps recruiters place you.
